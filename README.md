# ðŸš€ React App CI/CD with GitHub Actions & Azure App Service

Welcome to this project! This repository demonstrates a full CI/CD pipeline for a React application using:

- GitHub Actions for automation  
- Azure App Service for deployment  
- Feature-based branching and PR approvals  
- Zero manual deployment steps

---

## ðŸ“˜ What This Project Does

This project is set up to automate everything from code push â†’ to pull request â†’ to production-ready deployment:

### âœ… Key Highlights:
- Auto-creation of pull requests on any `feature/*` branch push
- Waits for 1 approval and merges to `dev` automatically
- Deployment to Azure happens **only from the `dev` branch**

> You write code â†’ push â†’ get coffee â˜• â†’ your app is deployed ðŸš€
